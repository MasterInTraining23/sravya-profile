						Finding and applying for the right scholarships can be confusing and time intensive if you don't know what you're looking for. There are hundreds of thousands of scholarships, and it's hard to know what each individual scholarship committee is looking for. I'm here to help you maximize your chances.
					</p>
					<p>
						When I was in my senior year of high school, I won numerous full university scholarships for different schools, as well as many outside merit scholarships. Though I turned down the universities that I received full rides from and went to MIT, I had my full tuition and over 2 years of additional costs covered.
					</p>
					<p>
						Unlike most other consultants, I'm not a self-proclaimed expert who has no real life experience in this process. I, myself, was a candidate for these scholarships and programs just 4 years ago! Additionally, I received zero financial aid, so everything that I state was covered is truly covered by merit scholarships that I worked hard for and earned.
					</p>
					<p>
						Scholarships won:
						<ul>
							<li class="scholarship-name">
								BlackBerry Scholarship (~$96,000/full tuition over 4 years)
							</li>
							<li class="scholarship-name">
								Coca-Cola Scholarship ($10,000)
							</li>
							<li class="scholarship-name">
								Vogt Achievement Scholarship ($10,000)
							</li>
							<li class="scholarship-name">
