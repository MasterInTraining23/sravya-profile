					<p>Standardized test prep can be stressful and tedious. It's incredibly important, however. It's one of the first metrics your application will be judged by and can make the difference for some applicants.<br><br>

					I scored a 36 on my ACT and an 800 on the SAT II Math and SAT II Chemistry. I also recently took my GMAT and scored a 760. Throughout high school, I tutored and volunteered with middle and high school students for ACT prep and raised scores by an average of 2 points! That can take you from a 30 to a 32 or a 34 to a perfect!<br><br>

					I will work with you personally on any and all sections you're having difficulty with. Only want help on one section? Totally fine! Need help with everything? Also fine!<br><br>

					If you're interested in receiving tutoring help, I offer low prices and high quality compared to the many tutoring services out there.<br><br>
					
					For students of any age, I will video chat and provide personalized help as well as essay feedback. Each session for ACT/SAT will be 1 hour and cost $50 per session. You can sign up for as many or as few sessions as you need. For GMAT, one session will cost $100.

					If you are interested, please reach my through my contact form. If you're not sure what you may be interested in, I'm happy to do a consultation call to make sure everyone's getting what they want.
