						<p class="about-content">Hello! My name is Sravya Vishnubhatla. I'm born and raised in Pittsburgh, PA, but my family moved to Louisville, KY during my high school. There I attended duPont Manual High School, one of the top 100 high schools in the nation. After high school, I attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) where I studied Computer Science and Management and will be graduating in June 2017.

						<br><br>After graduation, I will be moving across the country to Seattle, WA where I'll be working for Microsoft as a Program Manager! I can't wait to see what the other side of the country brings.

						<br><br>Aside from school and work, I'm an avid dancer and have been studying since the age of 4. I'm trained in the classical Indian dance form of Bharatanatyam, as well as tap, ballet, jazz, lyrical, and Bollywood fusion. Though I have a lot of engineering skills, I pride myself on my performance and humanities interests as well.

						<br><br>This site is complete with my accolades and experiences, so please feel free to take a look! I am also blessed to be the recipient of numerous merit scholarships - so many that my college tuition was 80% paid for through them! Take a look at my <a class="paragraph-anchor" href="html/scholarship_consulting.html">scholarship consulting</a> page for an extensive list of awards, as well as my services to help you reach your greatest potential.

						<br><br>If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me! </p>
