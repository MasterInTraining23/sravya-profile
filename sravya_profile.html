						<p class="about-content">Welcome to my page! A Pittsburgh native, my family moved to Louisville, KY during my high school years. There I attended duPont Manual High School, one of the top 100 high schools in the nation. After high school, I attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) where I studied Computer Science and Management and will be graduating in June 2017.

						<br><br>I now live in Seattle, WA where I work at Microsoft as a Program Manager! Aside from school and work, I'm an avid dancer and have been studying since the age of 4. I'm trained in Bharatanatyam and Kuchipudi (Indian classical dance) as well as tap, ballet, jazz, lyrical, and Bollywood fusion.

						<br><br>I am also blessed to be the recipient of numerous outside merit scholarships - so many that my college tuition was 80% paid for through them! Take a look at my <a class="paragraph-anchor" href="html/scholarship_consulting.html">scholarship consulting</a> page for an extensive list of awards, as well as my services to help you reach your greatest potential.
